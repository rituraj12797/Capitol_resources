// some doubts whihc i faced when building this 

// why are we defining the queue using a vector of fixed sizew ?? ==> we do so because dynamically allocating new memory at run time is low and so we define a fixed size one.
// what if it overflows ?? ===> we always have an estimate of how many requests per second are gonna come ==> say if avg is 10,000 we define the size to be 100x more than that so,
// practically it never overflows 

// also since this ia a ring buffer ==> write and read indices re start from 0 when they reach the end this will work 

// what if the reader has not read anythign and the queue is complete and now write pointer to teh head where the first piece of data is stored ===> now if you try to write to thix location you may los on the data 
// that was supposed to be read by the reader ==> CORRUPTION ?? ==> Umm not really, because for those scenarios we developed an approach ==> if any such scenarios arrive that writer head is pointing to reading head we will block the writer 
// from writing further entries untill the reader consumes data . ======> This is know as BACKPRESSURE






// there is a isssues with the write_head == read_head case  ==> this scenario is possible in 2 scenarios 
/*


	1. When circular buffer is empty => 

	             R

	2. When it is full

	             R
	_________________________
	|__2_|_3__|_4__|_5__|__7_|

	----------->W

	
	in the first scenario wew would prevent Read as no data is there 
	and in the second scenatio we would prevemt the Write as we need to wait for the consumer to consume the data 

	how do we differentiate whic case it it ?? ==> for this we maintain a empty block, i.e we never fill the ring buffer complete, we always leave it one block empty i.e in full state it willlook somethign like this 

3. Leave one block - desirable full state

	             R
	_________________________
	|__2_|____|_4__|_5__|__7_|

	------>W

	now we say that untill the reader does not moves this last block will nto be filled 

	==>/    if((write + 1) %size == Read )  this will mean full 
	===>     write == read means it is empty
